# Research Questions :

### 1- Difference between DBMS and RDBMS :

* DBMS "Database Management System" is software used to **store** , **manage** , and **retrieve data**

  #### It's Functions :

  - Stores data in files or tables

  - Allows insert, update, delete

  - Does not necessarily use relationships between tables

   **Ex** : Microsoft Access , Filemaker
   
---

* RDBMS "Relational Database Management System" is a type of DBMS that stores data in related tables using the relational model.
    
    #### It's Functions :
    - Stores data in tables (rows & columns)

    - Uses Primary Keys and Foreign Keys

    - Enforces relationships between tables

    - Supports SQL

    - Maintains data integrity

   **Ex** : MySQL , Oracle Database
   
---
### 2- Difference between DDL and DML :
 
* DDL is used to **define** or **modify** the **structure** of the database.
  
    #### It's Functions :
    - Creating tables

    - Modifying table structure

    - Deleting tables

> it changes the schema "Structure" of the **database**

 **Ex on it's commands** : CREATE , ALTER , DROP , TRUNCATE

---

* DML is used to manipulate the data inside the tables.

    #### It's Functions :
    - Inserting data

    - Updating data

   - Deleting data

   - Retrieving data

> It changes the data, not the structure.

**Ex on it's commands** : INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE , SELECT

---

### 3- Why is the Normalizaton important :

**Normalization**:

- Reduces data redundancy (no repeated data)
- Prevents update, insert, and delete anomalies
- Improves data integrity
- Makes the database more organized and efficient
 
 > **Normalization** give us a good schema which provide a **clean** and **consistant** database
